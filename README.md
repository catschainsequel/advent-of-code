# advent-of-code

These are my solutions to past [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

My only goal was to get to a working solution quickly. (Another way of reading that sentence: the code in here is incredibly messy and gross.) You may enjoy seeing the dirty details behind quick implementations, but please don't treat this as good code. (:
