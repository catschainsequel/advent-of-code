These are my solutions to past [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

They include a lot of the messiness and warts of getting to a working solution quickly. You may enjoy seeing some of the dirty details behind quick implementations, but make sure not to treat them as idealized solutions. (:
